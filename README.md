R-Shiny app predicting delays in flight arrival times

I created a quick multiple linear regression model based on flight data from 2008. The goal of the model was to be used to create a Shiny app that can be interacted with to predict delays in flight arrival times. Since the goal of this project was creating a Shiny app, the model was not tested thoroughly for being the best possible fit. The data I have available in this repository are the cleaned and simplified version I used for my model creation. The original data were pulled from https://www.kaggle.com/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses.
